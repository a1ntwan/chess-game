# Chess #

My simple game of chess for two players. The purpose of this project was not to create the most efficient chess engine, but just to practice some OOP.

First I've created this game without check/checkmate detecting mechanism, but then I decided to give a try. The result is a bit messy, hope you're not confused about it :)

Also, it was my first experience in unit-testing. I promise to use more test-driven deployment in the future :)
